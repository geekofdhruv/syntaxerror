Project Overview:
Many travelers struggle to find compatible travel partners, facing issues like mismatched schedules, safety concerns, and financial burdens. Existing social circles and platforms fail to connect like-minded travelers, leading to missed opportunities and challenges in managing costs and safety during trips.

Problem Statement:
Solo travelers, college students, and corporate employees passionate about traveling often struggle to find suitable companions. Challenges include difficulty in finding compatible travel partners due to mismatched schedules, budgets, or interests, and limited opportunities to meet like-minded travelers. Safety concerns, especially for solo female travelers, and financial burdens due to bearing costs alone, are significant issues. Additionally, reconnecting with old friends or acquaintances for travel purposes is often challenging. These factors contribute to missed travel opportunities and increased travel expenses, highlighting the need for a platform to connect travelers with similar interests and schedules.

Possible Solution:
This innovative website that connects users with compatible travel partners based on shared interests, schedules, and budgets. Key features include an interface for matching with like minded travelers, options to reconnect with old acquaintances for travel, built-in tools for splitting expenses, and the ability to join or merge travel groups. Users can expand their social and travel networks, connect with nearby individuals, and enjoy safety features like verified profiles, safety ratings, and real-time location sharing with trusted contacts. This can also be used to find local people with whom the traveler can experience much real city tour rather than just visiting the famous, crowded tourist spots moreover, locals have a better idea of nearby places and the prices in the city.
